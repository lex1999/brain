            THE PROJECT
      </h2>
      <p>
              We are working towards a better life for people with mental illnesses and for society in general. Because mental illnesses not only affect humans, they also affect the environment. Mental illnesses don’t care about where you came from, your race, and whether your rich or poor. Our plan is to get everyone to work together to close the gap between the physical brain and the mind. To do this we need to better our understanding of neurobiology. In order to do this, we need to fund more neurobiologists studies. All the profits from your mystery box will go towards funding a study for a mental disorder of your choice. Make a difference!

              THE HARD TRUTH
      </h2>
      <div>
              An estimated 61.2 million American adults are affected by a mental disorder.
      </div>
      <div>
      <div>
              Major depressive disorder affects about 15.7 million American adults.
      </div>
      <div>
              An estimated 9.6 million American adults have Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).

      <p>
            When people think of the word mental illness they usually think of this… no sweating, no fever, no rash, no fractures. No visible symptoms. According to the Los Angeles Times in 2018 “at least 59% of the 185 public mass shootings that took place in the United States from 1900 through 2017 were carried out by people who had either been diagnosed with a mental disorder or demonstrated signs of serious mental illness prior to the attack.“ Imagine being able to leave your house in the morning for school and not have to worry about whether or not that was going to be the last time you see your parents. Imagine being able to not have to wait in line for the metal detectors at school. Imagine a world where you don't have to bring a bulletproof backpack to school. Imagine not having to check your surroundings every five seconds. Imagine a world free of the threats that mental illnesses can bring.
